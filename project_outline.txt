The high level view of my project that will scrape a news website will be as follows.

Zerohedge.com has a simple way of accessing a lot of pages with simple changes to a url,
the plan will be to give the user access to the first 10 pages of information
The data to be scraped will be as follows
1. Article Headline
2. Article Description
3. Date/time article was published
4. Number of times article has been viewed at time of scrap
5. Number of comments

I anticipate that the coding will be broken into a number of modules
1. CLI functionality
2. Scraping functionality
3. Article Storage and manipulation

CLI functionality
